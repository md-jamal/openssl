Confidentiality, message integrity and authentication:

Confidentiality:

	The assurance to an entity that no one can read a particular piece
	of data except the receiver(s) explicitly intended.If information
	is read or copied by someone who is not authorized to do so,the
	result is known as loss of confidentiality.Confidentiality is
	very important attribute for information types like research data,
	medical and insurance records.

Integrity:

	The assurance to an entity that data has not been
	altered(intentionally or unintentionally) between "there" or
	"here", or between "then" and "now".It is now to whether the
	data in transit has been modified.Information can be corrupted
	when it is available on an insecure network. When information
	is modified in unexpected ways,the result is known as loss of
	integrity.Unauthorized changes can be made to the information,
	either by human error or intentional tampering.

Authentication:

	The assurance to one entity that another entity is who he/she
	claims to be.

	Authentication is proving that a user is whom he or she claims
	to be.That proof may involve something the user knows(such
	as password),something the user has (such as smartcard),or
	something about the user that proves the person's identity(such as
	fingerprint).Security is strong when the means of authentication
	cannot later be refuted(prove that is wrong)-the user cannot
	later deny that he or she performed the activity.This is known
	as nonrepudiation

Message Digest:

	It is a fixed size numeric representation of the contents of
	the message,computed by the hash function.Messages size may be
	variable but message digest size is fixed.Encryption of message
	digest is nothing but digital signature.

	So while sending,he generates a message digest and then encrypt
	the digest using the private key forming an a digital signature.At
	the receiving side,the signature must be decrypted by using public
	key will get you the message digest,then it has to compute the
	message digest of the received message and then compare both
	of them.If both of them are equal then the message has not
	been tampered.


Digital Certificate:

	It is used to bind a public key to owner.If the public key
	are sent directly by their owner to another entity,there is
	a risk that the message could be intercepted and the public
	key substituted by another.This is known as man in the middle
	attack.Solution to this problem is to exchange public keys
	through a trusted third party.Instead of sending your public
	key directly, you ask the trusted third party to integrate it
	into a digital certificate.The trusted third party that issues
	digital certificates is called a Certificate Authority(CA).


	Digital certificate contains specific pieces of information,as
	determined by X.509 standard.These piece of information include:
	...Owner Public Key ...Owner Distinguished Name ...Distinguished
	Name of the CA that issued the certificate ...Date from which
	the certificate is valid ...Expiry date of the certificate.
	...A serial number:This is a unique identifier assigned by the
	CA which issued
	   the certificate.The serial number is unique within the CA
	   which issued the		 certificate

	The digital signature in a personal certificate is generated using
	the private key of the CA which signed that certificate.Anyone
	who needs to verify the personal certificate can use the CA's
	public key to do so.The CA's certificate contains its public key.


Public Key Infrastructure:

	A PKI  is a system of facilities, policies, and services that
	supports the use of public key cryptography for authenticating
	the parties involved in the transaction.

	PKI typically comprises certificate authorities(CAs) and
	Registration Authorities(RAs).CAs provides the following services:
	.Issuing digital certificates .Validating digital certificates
	.Revoking digital certificates .Distributing public keys

	RAs verify that the information provided when digital certificates
	are requested.If the RA verifies the information,the CA can
	issue a digital certificate to the requester.


Self signed certificate:

	It is a certificate signed with its own private key.In typical PKI
	arrangements, a digital signature from a certificate authority
	attests that a particular public key certificate is valid.As
	the digital certificates is signed by the private key of CA ,
	now suppose if the user wants to check whether the data is
	correct or not he has to have the public key of the CA which
	is present in the digital certificate of the CA.This digital
	certificate will be signed by highest CA.Obviously the highest
	ranking CA's certificate can't be attested by some other higher
	CA(their being none),and so that the certificate can only be
	self-signed.Such certificates are termed as root certificates.

Format of the Certificate and Keys: .pem is the format


What is the need for CA?

	Consider friends bob and alice.Alice want to encrypt something
	to Bob.So Alice requires the private key of Bob.Alice searches
	for the private key of Bob in the internet,and Alice can't be
	sure that the public key she got is really of Bob.

	So Alice takes a different approach:will get the key from someone
	that can assure her that the key actually belongs to Bob.The CA
	does exactly that.

	How the CA does that?Simple Bob identifies himself to the CA
	and send his public key.This way,the CA have something relates
	the identity of Bob with his public key.


How Digital Signatures are Made?

	Digital signatures are typically made in a two-step process.The
	first step is to use a secure hashing algorithm on the data.SHA-2
	algorithms would be an example of that.The second step is to
	encrypt the resulting output with a private signing key.

	Thus when a signature is verified by the public key, it decrypts
	to a hash matching the message.

What is the information contained in the certificate?

	A certificate is a small structure which contains, in a
	conventional format: ...an identity(the name of the owner)
	...a public key(purportedly owned by that person) ...a digital
	signature computed over two previous parts by a certification
	Authority.

What happens during a HTTPS Web site access?

	During the initial phases of the connection between your browser
	and the web server, the server sends his certificate.The browser
	then verifies the certificate against a list of hardcoded CA
	public key(which have been included courtesy of the browser
	or operating system vendor).Once the browser has verified the
	certificate,it knows the public key, and uses it to establish
	the confidential tunnel with the server.


Hash Functions:

	A hash function is a completely public algorithm(no key
	in that)which mashes bit together in a way which is truly
	infeasible to untangle.anybody can run the hash function on
	any data,but finding the data back from the hash output appears
	to be much beyond our wit(intelligence).The hash output has a
	fixed size,typically 256 bits(with SHA-256) or 512 bits(with
	SHA-512).The SHA-* function which output 160 bits is called
	SHA-1,not SHA-160.

What is S in the HTTPS?

	Most people associate HTTPS with SSL(Secure Socket Layer)
	which was created  by Netscape in the mid 90's. This is
	becoming less true over time.As Netscape lost market share,SSL's
	maintenance moved to Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).The
	first post Netscape version was re-branded as Transport Layer
	Security(TLS)1.0 which was released in January 1999.

	By agreement of RFC 2818,Browser knews that https means it should
	connect to port 443.

Drawback of Public Key Cryptography:

	Public Key cryptography has a significant drawback, though it is
	intolerably slow for large messages. Symmetric key cryptography
	can usually be done quickly enough to encrypt and decrypt all the
	network traffic  a machine can manage.Public key cryptography
	is generally limited by the speed of the cryptography,not the
	bandwidth going into the computer,particularly on server machines
	that need to handle multiple connections simultaneously.

	As a result,most systems that use public key cryptography,
	SSL included, use it as little as possible.Generally, public
	key encryption is used to agree on an encryption key for a
	symmetric algorithm,and then all further encryption is done
	using the symmetric algorithm.Therefore, public key encryption
	algorithms are primarily used in key exchange protocols and when
	non-repudiation (cannot refuse to accept) is required.


What is Truststore?

	File that holds the various certificates of Certifying Authorities.
